## To build apps effectively
- To build apps effectively
- Start with a basic version of your app.
- Build iteratively by adding new features one at a time.
- Be specific in your requests for each iteration.
- Review and test each change before moving to the next.
- If something isn't working as expected, provide the error messages to the agent for troubleshooting.
- Complex apps are built step by step. Take your time and enjoy the process!

## Troubleshooting
- Check for errors in the UI and the Browser console.
- Check the browser console (F12 > Console) for JavaScript errors.
- If you encounter UI issues, describe them to the agent.

## Limitations:
- **Disclaimer**: The produced code should not be used in production without an additional review.
- **JavaScript**: The code uses JavaScript; we recommend using TypeScript for production apps.
- **String-Templated Queries**: The code uses JavaScript string-templated queries. We recommend using prepared statements instead. For more information, visit [Prepared Statements](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@motherduck/wasm-client#prepared-statements).
- **Authentication Flow**: If you want to learn more about how to add an authentication flow for external users, take a look at [this example](https://github.com/motherduckdb/wasm-client/blob/main/examples/nypd-complaints/src/ConnectPane.tsx).
