# My App

This template provides a minimal setup for MotherDuck data apps.

# Authentication

In this basic setup, your environment variable `motherduck_token` is used to authenticate the app to MotherDuck.

Check out the [ConnectPane.tsx](../../nypd-complaints/src/ConnectPane.tsx) as example for a more sophisticated authentication flow.
